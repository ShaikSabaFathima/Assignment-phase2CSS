Inline CSS is the technique to define the single element with the insert style sheets in an HTML document.
Inline elements display in a line. They do not force the text after them to a new line. An anchor (or link) is an example of an inline element. You can put several links in a row, and they will display in a line.</p>

<p style="border:1px solid black ; color: rgb(178, 130, 71);">
    Inline styles can be used for temporary styles that aren't intended to be shared with other elements or for short HTML / CSS mockups or prototypes. They may also be helpful when you need a short fix in operation while you resolve the problems locally; remove them once everything is working properly.</p>
